Store Your Data On The Internet. Literally.

Netstor allows for data persistence in volatile storage using the 
internet as the storage service. In theory, this allows data to be
stored in the queues and application storage of the servers and routers
in-between. Upon terminating the program, all data persistance will
be lost and any data stored in the network will overwritten by future
traffic.
